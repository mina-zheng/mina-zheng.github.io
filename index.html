                    <p> Since the beginning of my programming journey back in high school, I've been invested in artificial intelligence. I started from performing EDAs and building basic 
                    predictive models with Kaggle datasets, to now tackling more advanced areas like deep learning and LLMs. Although working in machine learning has always 
                    been my primary motive, I'm always looking for new skills and areas to explore, like web development and data scraping.
