                    <p>Hey there! I'm <span class = "variabletext">Mina Zheng</span>.
                    <br><br>I'm a rising sophomore at the <span class = "variabletext">University of Michigan</span> studying 
                    <span class = "variabletext">Data Science </span>and <span class = "variabletext">Statistics</span>.
                    My interests primarily lie in the potential of <span class = "variabletext">machine learning </span>and neural networks to find patterns 
                    where humans can't.

                    <p> Since the beginning of my programming journey back in high school, I've been invested in <span class = "variabletext">artificial intelligence</span>. I started from performing EDAs and building basic 
                    <span class = "variabletext">predictive models </span>with Kaggle datasets, to now tackling more advanced areas like <span class = "variabletext">deep learning </span>and <span class = "variabletext">LLMs</span>. 
                    Although working in <span class = "variabletext">machine learning </span> has always 
                    been my primary motive, I'm always looking for new skills and areas to explore, like web development and data scraping.
